                        Women face discrimination across the world. This had led to great disparity in education, 
                        income, wealth and health. Women account for just 10% of the world’s income and own less than 
                        1% of the world’s property. In India, the rate of literacy for men is 80.9 per cent as compared
                         to 64.6% for women, and their participation in labor force is only 29%. Women Empowerment implies giving them independence, and choice in how they want to lead their lives. Freedom to choose to pursue education, whom they want to marry, career, bringing up children and more. When a woman is empowered, she can identify her skills, knowledge & abilities to make her own decisions. Empowerment is an evolving growth process for her, which gives her self-esteem, confidence to face society, and participate in community development.

                        Brain Stew has identified the need for training in computers to the educated unemployed youth. We select the poor youth from rural villages, urban slums based on their family income, which should be low or below poverty line to be eligible for this program.

                    <p>Every financial year we select 50 deserving poor youth to impart 6 months software training. The course syllabus includes Computer Fundamentals, MS Office, DTP, Internet Concepts and Soft Skills. We mainly concentrate on job oriented courses to create sustainable livelihoods and employment opportunities. During the training we provide study material to all the trainees free of cost.</p>
